# PWC-Power-BI-Virtual-Internship


As part of the PwC Switzerland Virtual Internship by Forage, I successfully completed three key projects demonstrating my data analysis and Power BI dashboarding skills:

# ✨ Task 1: Call Center Analysis  
Objective: To analyze call records and deliver actionable insights that could help optimize call center performance and customer experience.

**Project Overview**:

Built an interactive “Call Center Analysis” dashboard using a dataset with detailed call records including Call ID, Agent Name, Topic, Call Resolution Status, Response Time, and Talk Duration.

Focused on deriving insights around call topics, agent performance, resolution rates, and customer satisfaction.

# Key Insights:

**Topic Distribution** : Most calls were related to payment and technical support. Streaming and admin support showed the lowest volumes.

**Resolution Rates** : High resolution observed in contract-related and technical issues.

**Speed of Answer**: Varied across topics — admin and contract-related queries had faster responses.

**Agent Performance**: Identified top-performing agents (e.g., Martha, Diane) based on resolution rates, talk time, and speed of response.

**Trend Analysis**: Peak call volumes occurred around 11 AM, 1 PM, and 5 PM — indicating ideal windows for optimized staffing.

**Customer Satisfaction**: Resolution status directly correlated with customer experience, suggesting that reducing unresolved queries should be a strategic focus.

**Training & Resource Allocation**: Topics with longer durations and lower resolution were flagged for potential training opportunities.

✅ These insights can serve as a foundation for further analysis and decision-making aimed at improving customer service operations and enhancing overall customer satisfaction.

# ✨ Task 2: Customer Churn Analysis
**Objective**: To assist a telecommunications client in identifying churn patterns and improving customer retention.

**Project Overview:**

Designed a churn analysis dashboard to study customer behavior based on demographics, service subscriptions, billing preferences, and tenure.

Analyzed a dataset of 7,043 customers, focusing on churn drivers and actionable retention strategies.

**Key Insights**:

**Churn Rate**: 26.54% churn observed; majority of churned users were short-tenure customers.

**Demographics**: Senior citizens accounted for 16.21% of customers but 25.46% of churns.

**Internet Services**: Fiber optic users showed the highest churn (69.39%), suggesting dissatisfaction or better competition.

**Support Services**: Customers with tech support and online security had lower churn rates, emphasizing the value of bundled services.

**Contract Type**: Long-term contracts had better retention rates than month-to-month agreements.

**Billing & Payments**: Paperless billing and payment method choices had influence on churn behavior.

# ➡️ Insights of the Projects :-  

**Overview**: Total customers are 7043 with number of retained customers is 5174 & customers churned are 1869.

The rate of retained customers is 73.46% & the rate of churned customers is 26.54%, amounting to $16.06M yearly charges and $456.12K monthly charges.

2955 tech tickets and 3632 admin tickets opened.

There are about 16.21% customers who are senior citizens & percentage of senior citizens in churned customers is 25.46%.

 **Demographics**:  

Churn rate is higher for customers who have opted for Internet Services. Customers with Fiber Optic services have higher churn rate that is 69.39%.

Average Tenure of customers is 32.37% & Average Tenure of churned customers is 17.89.

It is observed that, customers with low tenure are churned more.

# ✨ Task 3: Diversity & Inclusion Dashboard
**Objective**: To track and communicate progress on gender balance and inclusive practices within the organization.

**Project Overview:**

Built a KPI-driven “Diversity & Inclusion” dashboard to monitor hiring, promotion, performance, and turnover by gender across FY20 and FY21.

Supported a telecom client in creating a more balanced and inclusive work environment.

**Key Metrics Tracked**:

1)Total employees by gender

2)Hires, promotions, and performance ratings (men vs. women)

3)Gender-wise turnover percentages

4)Average performance scores segmented by gender

# ➡️ Key Performance Indicators ( KPI'S) :
➤ 𝐇𝐢𝐫𝐢𝐧𝐠:

By tracking % of hires Men vs. Women, we gain visibility into recruitment practices, ensuring a balanced workforce from the outset.

➤ 𝐏𝐫𝐨𝐦𝐨𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 :

Measuring % of promotions- Men vs. Women, identifying and celebrating talent, ensuring opportunities are equitable and merit-based.

➤ 𝐏𝐞𝐫𝐟𝐨𝐫𝐦𝐚𝐧𝐜𝐞 :

Assessing average performance ratings - Men vs. Women, pinpoint potential biases and create a fair evaluation system.

➤ 𝐓𝐮𝐫𝐧𝐨𝐯𝐞𝐫 :

Monitoring % turnover - Men vs. Women, identify areas of concern, ensuring our workplace retains diverse talent.

The ultimate objective is to adopt a practical, data-driven approach to addressing gender balance challenges in the workplace—focusing not only on setting strategic goals but also on measuring progress, analyzing outcomes, and continuously enhancing diversity and inclusion efforts.
